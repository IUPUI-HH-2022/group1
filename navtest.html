            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
            This website represents an international collaboration between students from Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (HH) 
            in Finland and Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in the U.S. 
            Coming from multiple countries and states, our group members bring to this project diverse experiences and insights, 
            which strengthens and enriches our work. 
            Under the supervision of Dr. William Helling (IUPUI—Information Structures for the Web) and Kaspar Valtakari 
            (HH—Orientation to Digital Services), we created this website as an informational resource regarding the broad spectrum of 
            accessibility and representation issues found in the international video gaming industry. 
            By shedding light on the issues and providing relevant resources, 
            we hope this site will be helpful for long-time gamers and gaming novices alike!

            Hello, my name is Christina and I’m from Portland, Oregon, USA. Formerly a pharmaceutical clinical researcher for 18+ years, 
            I’m currently a university archives coordinator and working toward my Master of Library and Information Science at 
            Indiana University—Purdue University Indianapolis, specializing in archives management. Completely new to both programming languages and 
            video gaming, I’ve been enjoying learning about both topics during this course and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned so far.

             Hi, I’m Gabrielle, I study Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences with a core focus and passion on programming and design.  
             I moved to Finland from South Africa in December 2020 with my partner.
             I have about 7 years of experience working as a hairstylist, gaining a keen eye for detail, design, and beauty, as well as communication skills which I hope to utilize in my new career path of software development. 
             I enjoy spending my free time reading, watching sci-fi /fantasy films, or playing fantasy/sci-fi games. When I do venture outdoors on occasion, I enjoy exploring the beautiful nature Finland has to offer.

            Hello, my name is David Fiora and I am a graduate student in the Master of Library and Information Science program at IUPUI, 
            specializing in Archival Studies. Prior to coming to IUPUI, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in History with a minor in Political 
            Science and an undergraduate certificate in Legal Studies from the University of Cincinnati.  Currently, I work for the Public 
            Library of Hamilton County and Cincinnati. I enjoy how I am able to make a difference in peoples’ lives through the work that I do 
            as a librarian. This collaboration with Haaga Helia will improve not only my technology skills, but also my project management and 
            team work skills inside the library.
