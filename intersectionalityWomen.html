       <h1>Additional Difficulties Women Face in Games</h1> 
       <p>
           By Gabrielle Baker
           <br>

       <br>
       <img class="womenimg" src="images/womenPageHeaderImage.png" alt="Collage of women">
       <p>
        Women make up nearly half of all gamers globally, the statistics ranging from 41% of the market in the United States to 45% 
        across Asian countries, which alone make up nearly half of the gaming population globally <sub><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomokoyokoi/2021/03/04/female-gamers-are-on-the-rise-can-the-gaming-industry-catch-up/?sh=386499ddf9fe " target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[12]</a></sub>. 
        <br>
       <br>Yet, gaming poses unique challenges to the women who decide to play. 
    </p>
       <h2>Sexualization of Characters </h2>
       <p>
        A glance into most games will quickly prove it to be a world catered nearly exclusively to the male fantasy. 
        Female characters in games, both non-player characters (NPCs) and player characters (PCs) alike, are frequently depicted as 
        sexual objects. Animations are grossly exaggerated and body types and proportions are hyper sexualized and not customizable, 
        with outfits consisting of heels and little else, while the male counterparts remain fully armored and usually with more 
        realistic animations. This does not even touch on the broad lack of transgender, nonbinary, and LGBTQIA+ characters. 
        <br>
        <br>
           This was once again witnessed in Amazon’s latest acquisition, <em> Lost Ark </em>, where female characters are seldom granted sufficient 
        clothing, body types are one-size-fits-all, female characters have ridiculous animations, such as walk cycles exaggerating 
        the swing of female characters’ hips, and classes are gender-locked.  
           Below we see a tweet displaying the exaggerated walk cycle noticed in <em> Lost Ark. </em> 
       </p>
       <br>

        <p>
        While the game has been praised for its stellar storyline and combat, it has been criticized for being extremely tone 
        deaf when it comes to female characters. While character customizability allows players to create characters that represent 
        them, the appeal is quickly lost when the character’s body type and class are locked into a gender binary and then are stripped
        down upon entry into the game. This is depicted in the image below, a snippet of a personal character in <em> Lost Ark</em>, <!--italicized video game title, DF 5/5--> who left 
        character creation fully clothed in battle gear, only to enter the game in the outfit shown below. Every subsequent outfit 
        found in-game has been similarly disappointing.

        <h2>The Unrealized Effects and the Solution</h2>
        <p>
        In a world where nearly half of assigned-female-at-birth (AFAB) individuals experience some form of body dysmorphia, 
        with that number being significantly higher for transgender and non-binary individuals, it is shocking that video game 
        companies are still portraying characters in this manner <sub><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/half-of-women-experience-body-dysmorphia-here-are-the-signs_uk_619cb77ee4b07fe20110697b" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[2]</a></sub>. 
        The WHO estimates nearly 70 million people worldwide have an 
        eating disorder, and that number has been on the rise in the last decade, with prevalence nearly doubling from 3.4% to 7.8%, 
        and women and non-binary individuals accounting for 90% of that number <sub><a href="https://www.singlecare.com/blog/news/eating-disorder-statistics/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[9]</a></sub>. 
        With an obvious lack of realistic representation and the prevalence of characters that are often distasteful to female players,
        it is a wonder that such a substantial percentage of global gamers are female. 
         
        </p>

       <h2>Sexual Harassment and Gender-Based Discrimination</h2>
       <p>
        Sexual harassment is prevalent in every aspect of female-presenting individuals’ lives, and the gaming environment is no 
        different. Getting more women involved in video game development would significantly improve the ability of characters and 
        storylines to reflect a woman’s perspective. The question is, how is that supposed to happen when sexism, gender-based 
        discrimination, and sexual harassment are so deeply saturated in game development workspaces? These issues affect the very 
        women working in the game development industry attempting to make the necessary changes, as much as they affect the women 
        playing the games.  
        <br>
        <br>
           Activision Blizzard, the creator of games such as <em> Call of Duty </em> and <em>World of Warcraft </em>, were sued by the State of California 
        for discrimination against female employees, sexual harassment, and failing to take steps to prevent discrimination, harassment,
        and retaliation. When the company released a statement denying the claims, more than 3000 employees signed a letter calling 
        the statement abhorrent and insulting, as well as staging a walkout and virtual protest that led to the resignation of the
        president of Blizzard and their head of HR. While one hopes that women’s voices are making a difference, it can be 
        disheartening to know that since the previous lawsuit in 2021, yet another sexual harassment lawsuit has been raised 
        against Blizzard in 2022.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Another example of the issues faced by women working in the gaming industry is Zoe Quinn, a game developer whose ex-boyfriend 
        led an anti-progressive and sexist online harassment campaign against her in 2014, known as Gamergate. Quinn’s ex-boyfriend 
        claimed an unethical relationship had occurred between Quinn and a journalist, implying that her success did not stem from 
        her own work but rather from sexual favors, a common method used to invalidate the success of women. This led to the birth 
        of the harassment campaign against her, which included doxing, threats of rape, and death threats that led to her fleeing her
        home and seeking protection with law enforcement. In January 2015, Quinn co-founded Crash Override, a private network of 
        experts to assist victims of online harassment. It is notable that such a network need exist. 
        <br>
        <br>
        While women working in gaming companies battle sexual harassment and discrimination, the women playing the games face a 
        similar battle on another front. A study by the Anti-Defamation League in 2019 found that 65% of gamers in the U.S. 
        have been severely harassed, including "physical threats, stalking and sustained harassment," while 74% reported experiencing
        "some form of harassment" while playing. This has led to some 59% of women masking their gender while playing, including not
        using a microphone for fear that male players will realize a female is playing among them <sub><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/a-new-survey-confirms-that-most-women-gamers-have/ " target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[5]</a></sub>. 
        In the instances where women have not hidden their gender, they are frequently met with immediate harassment or players dropping out
        of teams to avoid playing alongside a woman, as many male gamers are either unwilling to share a gaming space with a woman or
        hold discriminatory beliefs that female players are inferior. These actions add immediate difficulties to the game for women. 
       <br>
       <br>
       Below you will find further statistics from a survey done in 2019 of 388 female video game players.

       <h2>E-sports </h2>
       <p>
        For women seeking to make a career of E-sports (electronic sports: online multiplayer video game competitions for spectators,
        performed by professional gamers) or streaming (recorded or live broadcasts of players playing video games for spectators,
        performed by professional and amateur gamers alike), the burden of harassment and discrimination is an additional difficulty.
        While there is no question about the gender pay gap existing, it is far worse in E-sports. The pay gap between the top 10 
        E-sports players based on gender ranges to nearly 3 million USD in favor of the male players <sub><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/female-gamers-harassed-after-revealing-gender-online-survey/ " target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sub>.

           </a>
        </blockquote>
           <br>
        Streaming does not fare much better, as all top 10 male streamers have more viewers than the top female streamer 
        <sub><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/female-gamers-harassed-after-revealing-gender-online-survey/ " target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[1]</a></sub>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To quote Chiquita Evans, the first woman to be drafted into the NBA 2K League (E-sport league):
        <blockquote>
        “I can personally testify that in-game harassment is still very much alive and kicking. 
        Over the years I’ve had unsolicited and explicit dms and whispers,as well as abuse over voice chat, with numerous sexist 
        statements and names used. 
        <br>
        <br>  
        Almost always the harassment has begun after I’ve revealed myself as female in some way, either by speaking or by having a
        gender specific avatar or username.” 
        </blockquote>
       

       <h2>Stigma Against Games Less Played by Males</h2>
       <p>
        The discrimination continues in a different direction when looking at games that are less frequently enjoyed by males and
           contain less violence and competitiveness. Games such as <em> Animal Crossing </em> and <em>The Sims </em> <! - - italicized game titles, DF 5/5 --- >  have frequently been discriminated 
         against by male gamers, disparaged as “not being real games” and their players “not real gamers” due to the lack of male 
         interest and competitiveness. Despite male discrimination and stigma surrounding what has been deemed ‘chill games,’ these 
         games enjoy continued wide-spread popularity, evidencing the need for a broader spectrum of game types to satisfy the 
         diversity of the market. During the 2020 Covid 19 pandemic, such games saw an incredible rise in popularity. 
          <em> Animal Crossing </em>, in particular, enjoyed 11 million players globally, including celebrities, as people used the game as a 
         means of connection during a troubling and isolating time <sub><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/may/13/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-game-coronavirus " target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">[6]</a></sub>.

       <h2>Gaming Experience and Societal Norms </h2> 
       <p>
        Another difficulty many women experience while gaming is that most games have a similar, intuitive system that takes time 
        to become accustomed to in order to play a game as it is intended. Society tends to normalize boys playing computer/video 
        games from an early age, and parents are frequently happy to allow a young boy ample screen time, plus computer games and 
        equipment as gifts, while these are still less common and, in some instances, frowned upon for girls, despite many of them 
        having the same level of interest in gaming. Such practices seem counter intuitive considering the number of female players 
        globally, but this societal norm gives male players an immediate advantage in building experience and in-game intuition. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The difficulty new players face when approaching games with a lack of experience and intuition can be further examined in 
        the following video by Razbuten. 
       </p>
       
       <div class="mycontainer">
        <iframe class="youtubeVideo" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ax7f3JZJHSw" title="YouTube video player" 
       ></iframe>
       </div>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, online gaming spaces seldom allow room for new or inexperienced players, and cyberbullying becomes 
        prevalent when a player is not immediately as skilled or experienced as their counterparts, a problem that is only 
        amplified when the other players discover the player to be a woman.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Clearly, the industry needs more women, people of color, and LGBTQIA+ individuals involved with the development of 
        games in order to create diverse, relatable, and realistic characters and storylines that are enjoyable to this 
        large unrealized demographic of players.
